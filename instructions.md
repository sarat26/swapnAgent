## Monthly Pack Agent -- Overview 

1. What the Agent Does: 
- Every month, the agent creates a personalized “Monthly Pack” for the user.
- The pack includes five recommendations: a perfume, a TV show or movie, a wine, a book or podcast, and a hiking trail.
- Each item is selected to match the user’s preferences and presented with a warm, easy-to-read summary.

2. Data Sources and APIs: 
- **Perfume:** product catalogs (e.g., Amazon or retailer feeds).
- **TV and Movies:** The Movie Database (TMDB).
- **Books:** Google Books.
- **Podcasts:** iTunes/Apple Podcasts API.
- **Wine:** Wine.com or similar catalog APIs.
- **Hiking Trails:** Hiking Project API or local place data.

3. User Information: 
The agent uses the user_data.md file to get specifications on what the user likes. This will include specific preference data such as: 
- Favorite perfume scent families.
- Wine styles and budget range.
- Preferred genres for TV, movies, and books.
- Topics of interest for podcasts.
- Hiking comfort levels, like maximum distance or elevation.
- Location, so hiking recommendations are nearby.

4. How it Works: 
- At the start of each month, the agent pulls fresh suggestions from the APIs.
- It selects one recommendation from each category that best matches the user’s profile.
- The agent then sends or stores a friendly “Monthly Pack” summary that explains why each item was chosen.
- Over time, the agent can gather simple feedback (likes/dislikes) to improve future recommendations.
